            <p class ="big">
                The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, took the world by storm. The first outbreak started in late 2019. As of April 28, 2021, there have been 32,928,354 cases and 587,406 deaths in the US. Since then, many scientists have worked tirelessly on a vaccine which was finally rolled out to the public on December 14, 2020. This was the start of COVID recovery in the US.
